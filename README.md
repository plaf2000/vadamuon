# VadaMuon
Code for the ETH Deep Learning course project paper on "Disentangling Sharpness and Update Geometry in the Muon Optimizer: Ablations, Stability and Variational Extensions" by Fricke, Ovcharova and Laffranchi.

This is a fork from [the implementation](https://github.com/emtiyaz/vadam/tree/master) of the paper on "[Fast and Scalable Bayesian Deep Learning by Weight-Perturbation in Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04854)" by Khan, Nielsen, Tangkaratt, Lin, Gal, and Srivastava.


The repo contains the code used for the Experiment 4. The experiment was only conducted on the MNIST dataset, therefore the parts not relevant for this were left unchanged.

Please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/plaf2000/vadamuon/pytorch/}) in the pytorch folder for more information.
